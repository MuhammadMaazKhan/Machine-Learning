## 🍽️ What is the Dataset About?

**Dataset Name:** `Restaurant_Reviews.tsv`
**Format:** Tab-separated values (TSV)
**Rows:** 1,000 reviews
**Columns:**

* `Review`: A customer review about a restaurant (text)
* `Liked`: Target variable (0 = negative sentiment, 1 = positive sentiment)

**Example:**

| Review                                           | Liked |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| "Wow\... Loved this place."                      | 1     |
| "Crust is not good."                             | 0     |
| "Not tasty and the texture was just nasty."      | 0     |
| "Stopped by during the late May bank holiday..." | 1     |

# 🍽️ Restaurant Reviews Sentiment Analysis

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Name:** Restaurant_Reviews.tsv
- **Size:** 1000 samples
- **Format:** TSV (Tab-separated)
- **Columns:**
  - `Review`: Text data (customer review)
  - `Liked`: Binary label (1 = Positive, 0 = Negative)

## 🧠 Objective
Build a machine learning model that predicts whether a given restaurant review is positive or negative.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Regular Expressions
- CountVectorizer (Bag of Words)

## 📚 Steps Implemented
1. Data Importing & Cleaning
2. Text Preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
3. Feature Extraction using Bag of Words
4. Model Training (Multinomial Naive Bayes)
5. Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)
6. Predicting sentiment on new reviews

## 📈 Model Used
- Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier


## 📦 Future Improvements
- Use TF-IDF instead of CountVectorizer
- Try different models (Logistic Regression, SVM, LSTM)
- Deploy using Flask or Streamlit


✅ **This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates core NLP techniques with a real-world dataset.**
