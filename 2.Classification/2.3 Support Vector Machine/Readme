### 2.3 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Goal**: Find the best line (or hyperplane) that separates two classes.
- **Works well with**: Clear margin of separation between classes.


## ðŸ§  Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier â€“ Social Network Ads

### ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model for binary classification.
It is part of a broader machine learning exercise to compare the performance of different classifiers including
**Logistic Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and now **SVM**.

We aim to predict whether a customer will purchase a product (SUV) based on two features: **Age** and **Estimated Salary**.
This project uses the classic **Social\_Network\_Ads.csv** dataset and highlights model training, evaluation, 
and visualization of decision boundaries.

### ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

**Filename**: `Social_Network_Ads.csv`
**Total Observations**: 400 rows
**Columns**:

* `User ID`: Unique identifier for the user (not used in modeling)
* `Gender`: Gender of the user (not used in modeling)
* `Age`: Age of the user (used as a feature)
* `EstimatedSalary`: Estimated annual salary (used as a feature)
* `Purchased`: Target variable (0 = Not Purchased, 1 = Purchased)

### âœ… Objective

Build and evaluate an SVM classifier using Scikit-Learn to:

* Train a model using Age and Estimated Salary.
* Predict whether a user will purchase the product.
* Visualize the decision boundary.
* Compare results with previous models (Logistic Regression, KNN).
