### 2.2 Logistic Regression
- **Used for**: Binary or multiclass classification.
- **Output**: Probability between 0 and 1, converted into class labels.
- **Example**: Predicting if an email is spam or not.



## ü§ñ Logistic Regression ‚Äì Social Network Ads Classification

### üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Logistic Regression**, a fundamental classification algorithm in machine learning.
The use case is a **marketing prediction task** for a car company: identifying which previous customers are most likely to
purchase a newly released **SUV** based on their personal attributes.


As a data scientist working for a car manufacturer, your goal is to build a model that classifies customers into two categories:

* **1 (Yes)** ‚Äì Likely to buy the new SUV
* **0 (No)** ‚Äì Unlikely to buy the new SUV

The final model will help the **marketing and advertising team** target social media ads more effectively, improving conversion 
rates and advertising ROI.

### üìÅ Dataset Description: `Social_Network_Ads.csv`

This dataset contains **user demographic information** and their **previous purchasing behavior** related to older SUV models.
Each row corresponds to a different customer. The dataset includes:

| Feature           | Description                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `User ID`         | Unique identifier for each customer (not used in model training)          |
| `Gender`          | Gender of the customer (optional for modeling)                            |
| `Age`             | Age of the customer (used for training)                                   |
| `EstimatedSalary` | Annual estimated salary in dollars (used for training)                    |
| `Purchased`       | **Target variable**: 1 if the customer bought a previous SUV, 0 otherwise |

üîç **Features used in model**:

* `Age`
* `EstimatedSalary`

üéØ **Target variable**:

* `Purchased` (0 or 1)

This classification problem is a **binary classification task**, and logistic regression is used to draw a decision 
boundary between customers likely or unlikely to buy the new SUV.
