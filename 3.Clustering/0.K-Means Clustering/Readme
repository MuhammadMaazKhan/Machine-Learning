### K-Means Clustering
- **Goal**: Divide data into `K` clusters (groups).
- **How it works**:
  - Choose number of clusters (`K`)
  - Assign data points to the nearest cluster center
  - Update cluster centers based on current assignments
  - Repeat until convergence
- **Good for**: Customer segmentation, grouping similar items
- **Note**: Sensitive to initial values and requires choosing `K`
