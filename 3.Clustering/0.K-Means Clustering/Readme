### K-Means Clustering
- **Goal**: Divide data into `K` clusters (groups).
- **How it works**:
  - Choose number of clusters (`K`)
  - Assign data points to the nearest cluster center
  - Update cluster centers based on current assignments
  - Repeat until convergence
- **Good for**: Customer segmentation, grouping similar items
- **Note**: Sensitive to initial values and requires choosing `K`


## 🛍️ Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project focuses on implementing **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers of a mall into distinct groups based on
their annual income and spending behavior. The goal is to help the mall's strategic or marketing team better understand customer
patterns and tailor services or marketing strategies accordingly.

### 📊 Project Objective

The purpose of this unsupervised machine learning project is to analyze customer data to **identify clusters or patterns** in
purchasing behavior. Unlike classification or regression tasks where labels are known, clustering helps
**discover hidden groupings** within the dataset without prior labels.

### 📁 Dataset Description

**Filename:** `Mall_Customers.csv`
**Source:** \[UCI ML Repository / Kaggle]

Each row in the dataset represents a unique customer, and the dataset includes the following features:

* `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
* `Gender`: Gender of the customer (`Male` or `Female`).
* `Age`: Age of the customer.
* `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
* `Spending Score (1-100)`: Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature. A higher score indicates
                             higher spending.

### 🧠 What is Clustering?

Clustering is an **unsupervised learning** technique used to group similar data points together. In this project,
we use the **K-Means algorithm** to group customers into clusters based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**,
allowing the business to:

* Understand distinct customer profiles
* Design targeted marketing campaigns
* Optimize customer relationship strategies

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

### ✅ Outcome

The final output visualizes customer segments in 2D space, helping identify:

* High-income high-spending customers
* Low-income low-spending customers
* Other intermediate customer profiles
