### Hierarchical Clustering
- **Goal**: Build a hierarchy of clusters (tree-like structure)
- **Types**:
  - Agglomerative (bottom-up): Start with individual points and merge them
  - Divisive (top-down): Start with all data and split into smaller clusters
- **Output**: Dendrogram (a tree diagram showing merges/splits)
- **Good for**: Understanding data structure, when you don't know `K`


📊 Hierarchical Clustering on Mall Customers Dataset
🧠 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of Hierarchical Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to segment 
customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups for targeted 
marketing strategies in a retail business.

Using a dendrogram, we determine the optimal number of clusters and then apply Agglomerative Clustering to group customers with 
similar behavior. The results are visualized for better interpretability.

📁 Dataset Description: Mall_Customers.csv
The dataset contains data about customers of a shopping mall. Each row represents a customer and includes the following features:

Column Name	              Description
CustomerID	      Unique ID assigned to each customer
Gender	           Gender of the customer (Male/Female)
Age	               Age of the customer
Annual Income	     Annual income of the customer (in $1000s)
Spending Score	    Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature (1–100)

In this project, we only use:

Annual Income (feature index 3)

Spending Score (feature index 4)

These two features help us discover meaningful patterns and segments among customers.

🚀 Key Steps
Data Preprocessing: Selecting relevant features (Annual Income, Spending Score)

Dendrogram Visualization: To identify the optimal number of clusters

Model Building: Applying Agglomerative Clustering

Visualization: Plotting the clusters to show customer segments

📌 Objective
To help businesses:

Understand customer behavior

Improve marketing and recommendation strategies

Personalize offerings to customer segments
