### Hierarchical Clustering
- **Goal**: Build a hierarchy of clusters (tree-like structure)
- **Types**:
  - Agglomerative (bottom-up): Start with individual points and merge them
  - Divisive (top-down): Start with all data and split into smaller clusters
- **Output**: Dendrogram (a tree diagram showing merges/splits)
- **Good for**: Understanding data structure, when you don't know `K`
