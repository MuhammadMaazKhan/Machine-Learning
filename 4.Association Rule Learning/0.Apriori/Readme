## Apriori Algorithm
- **Goal**: Find frequent itemsets and generate association rules.
- **How it works**:
  - Step 1: Find itemsets that occur more than a minimum threshold (support).
  - Step 2: Generate rules with high confidence and lift.
- **Useful for**: Recommender systems, shopping cart analysis.
- **Example rule**: If a customer buys bread and butter â†’ they are likely to buy milk.

ðŸ›’ Association Rule Learning â€“ Market Basket Analysis
This project demonstrates Association Rule Learning using the Apriori algorithm to uncover interesting relationships between 
items in customer transactions. It's based on a classic Market Basket Optimization scenario, where the goal is to identify product
combinations frequently purchased together. These insights can be used to design effective marketing strategies like "Buy X, 
Get Y Free" or product recommendations similar to "Customers who bought this also bought...".

ðŸ“ˆ Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:

Apply the Apriori algorithm to discover strong association rules from transaction data.

Use metrics like Support, Confidence, and Lift to evaluate the strength and relevance of the discovered rules.

Identify the most influential product combinations that can help a business improve sales, customer satisfaction, and
cross-selling opportunities.

ðŸ“¦ Dataset â€“ Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv
The dataset contains 7,500 customer transactions collected over a one-week period from a small grocery store in the South of France.

Each row represents a transaction (or shopping basket).

Each transaction contains a list of products purchased together by a customer.

The data is unstructured, with varying numbers of products per transaction and stored in CSV format.

Example Rows:


Shrimp, Almonds, Avocado, Vegetable mix, Green grapes, Whole wheat pasta, Olive oil  
Burgers, Meatballs, Eggs  
Chutney  
Turkey, Avocado, Tomatoes, Lettuce
...

ðŸ§  Techniques Used
Apriori Algorithm for rule mining

Data Preprocessing to structure transaction data

Lift, Confidence, and Support metrics for rule evaluation

Python Implementation via mlxtend library

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab for interactive development

ðŸ“Š Output
A list of discovered association rules, such as:

Rule: {milk, bread} â†’ {butter}
Support: 0.05 | Confidence: 0.6 | Lift: 1.5
Sorted by descending lift to highlight the most impactful rules first.

ðŸ’¼ Real-world Applications
E-commerce & retail product recommendation engines (e.g., Amazon)

Promotional offer strategies

Inventory management

Cross-selling and up-selling analysis
