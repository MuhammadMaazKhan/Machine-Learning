Imagine you're trying to bake the best cake. 🍰
You try different amounts of sugar, different oven temperatures, and different baking times.

You try every combination:

1 spoon sugar + 150°C + 20 minutes

2 spoons sugar + 150°C + 20 minutes

1 spoon sugar + 180°C + 25 minutes

...and so on.

Then you taste each cake and pick the one that’s the most yummy!

🎯 This is like Grid Search:
You try all possible combinations of settings to find the best one.

Grid Search is a technique used in machine learning to find the best hyperparameters for a model.

🔍 It does this by:

Defining a grid of possible values (like a menu of choices).

Trying every combination of those values.

Evaluating each one (often using cross-validation).

Picking the one with the best performance.
