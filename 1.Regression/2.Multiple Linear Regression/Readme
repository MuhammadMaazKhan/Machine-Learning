# 2. Multiple Linear Regression
## Purpose: Predict a target variable using two or more features.

## Theory: Extends simple linear regression to multiple variables (y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bnxn).

## Use Case: Predicting house prices based on area, number of bedrooms, and location.

📊 Multiple Linear Regression – Predicting Startup Profits
🧠 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression to predict the profit of startups 
based on different expenditures and categorical information. It simulates a real-world scenario where a venture capital (VC) 
fund wants to make smart investment decisions by analyzing historical startup data.

📁 Dataset Description: 50_Startups.csv
The dataset includes financial data for 50 startups across various states in the USA. 
Each row represents a startup and includes several independent variables that might influence the profit.

📄 Columns:
Column Name	Description
R&D Spend       :	Amount spent on research and development
Administration	: Expenses for administration (e.g., employee salaries, ops)
Marketing Spend	: Advertising and marketing expenses
State	          : Categorical feature - State where the startup is located
Profit	        : Target variable – profit earned by the startup

🎯 Problem Statement
A venture capital firm wants to predict the profit of a startup based on its spending in various areas and its state.
The goal is to help guide investment decisions using machine learning.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-Learn

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

🔄 Workflow Summary
✅ 1. Data Preprocessing
Check for missing values.

Apply One Hot Encoding to the State column (categorical variable).

Split the dataset into Training and Test sets.

✅ 2. Model Training
Simple Linear Regression: Use one independent variable (e.g., R&D Spend) to predict profit.

Multiple Linear Regression: Use all independent variables (R&D, Administration, Marketing, and State) to train a more robust model.

✅ 3. Model Evaluation
Compare predictions with actual test data.

Analyze R² Score to assess model performance.

📌 Key Insights
R&D Spend has the strongest correlation with profit.

Multiple Linear Regression provides better predictive accuracy than simple regression.

Categorical features like State need to be encoded properly using One Hot Encoding before model training.
