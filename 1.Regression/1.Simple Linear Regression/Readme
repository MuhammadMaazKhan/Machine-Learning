# 1.Simple Linear Regression

## Purpose: Predict a target variable using one input feature.

## Theory: Fits a straight line (y = mx + b) to minimize the difference between predicted and actual values using least squares.

## Use Case: Predicting salaries based on years of experience


This project is about **Simple Linear Regression**, a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used to model 
the relationship between two variables: one **independent (predictor)** and one **dependent (target)** variable.

### 🔍 **Project Summary**

The project's goal is to predict potato yield (in tons)** based on the amount of nitrogen fertilizer used (in kilograms)** on a farm.
It demonstrates how simple linear regression can be used to draw a line of best fit using data points collected from multiple harvests to make predictions.

### 📊 **Dataset Description**

While no real dataset is provided in the instructor's narration, the implied dataset would look like this:

| **Fertilizer (kg)** | **Potato Yield (tons)** |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1                   | 11                      |
| 2                   | 14                      |
| 3                   | 17                      |
| ...                 | ...                     |

Each row in the dataset represents:

* The **amount of nitrogen fertilizer** used during a specific harvest.
* The **corresponding yield of potatoes** obtained in that season.

These data points are used to fit the simple linear regression model.

### 📈 **Model Equation**

From the example:

* **Intercept (b₀)** = 8 tons → This is the base yield when no fertilizer is used.
* **Slope (b₁)** = 3 tons/kg → This is the expected increase in yield for each additional kg of fertilizer.

**Equation:**

Potato Yield=8+3×(Fertilizer Used)

### 🧠 **Purpose of the Project**

* To **understand** how simple linear regression works.
* To learn how to **interpret** model coefficients (intercept and slope).
* To **visualize** the regression line on a scatter plot of real-world data.
* To **predict outcomes** (e.g., estimate yield for 5 kg fertilizer).
