# 1.Simple Linear Regression

## Purpose: Predict a target variable using one input feature.

## Theory: Fits a straight line (y = mx + b) to minimize the difference between predicted and actual values using least squares.

## Use Case: Predicting salaries based on years of experience


🥔 Simple Linear Regression – Predicting Potato Yield Based on Fertilizer Use
📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of Simple Linear Regression to model and predict potato yield (in tons)
based on the amount of nitrogen fertilizer used (in kilograms). It offers a clear and intuitive example of how a 
single independent variable can be used to predict a continuous output variable in agriculture.

🌾 Real-World Scenario
Imagine you're a data analyst helping a farmer understand how fertilizer impacts potato production.
Over several growing seasons, the farmer recorded:

      - How much nitrogen fertilizer (in kg) was used

      - The resulting potato harvest (in tons)

Using this data, we train a regression model to uncover the relationship between fertilizer input and potato yield. 
This helps predict future yields and optimize fertilizer usage.

📁 Dataset Description
This dataset is synthetic and designed for learning purposes, but it mimics real-world agricultural logging.

📄 Columns:
Column Name	Description
Fertilizer_Used :	Amount of nitrogen fertilizer used (in kilograms)
Potato_Yield	  : Potato output in tons

Each row represents a different harvest season.

✏️ Regression Model Formula
The Simple Linear Regression equation used is:
     Potato_Yield = b0 + b1 * Fertilizer_Used

      Potato_Yield = 8 + 3 * Fertilizer_Used
Where:

b0 = 8 → Baseline yield without fertilizer (tons)

b1 = 3 → Additional yield per kg of fertilizer used (tons/kg)

These values are hypothetical and used for illustrative purposes.

📊 Visual Representation
The model is visualized using a scatter plot:

X-axis: Fertilizer used (kg)

Y-axis: Potato yield (tons)

Each point = one harvest season

Regression line = best fit line predicting yield based on fertilizer

🧪 Applications
