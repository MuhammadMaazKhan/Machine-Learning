### 5. Decision Tree Regression
- Splits data into smaller parts using conditions.
- Good for non-linear data, does not need feature scaling.
- **Example**: Predicting values based on decision rules.


🌳 Decision Tree Regression – Predicting Salaries by Position Level
📌 Project Overview
This project uses a Decision Tree Regression model to predict an employee's salary based on their position level in a company.
It's designed to demonstrate how tree-based models can learn and split data based on decision rules, even for small datasets
with non-linear relationships.

We explore how decision trees handle regression problems without requiring feature scaling, making them especially useful in
cases where interpretability and minimal preprocessing are preferred.

👔 Real-World Scenario
You're working in the HR analytics department. A job candidate claims they earned $160,000 in their previous role at a 
different company, where they held a position level of 6.5. You have access to that company's historical position and salary data.

The goal is to build a Decision Tree Regression model to:

Learn how salaries relate to position levels

Predict the salary for someone at position level 6.5

Visualize how the model segments the data using decision rules

📁 Dataset Description
The dataset contains 10 observations with the following two columns:

Column Name	Description
Level	: Position level in the company (1 to 10)
Salary :	Corresponding salary for the position (USD)

🧪 Sample Data:
Level	Salary
1	45,000
2	50,000
3	60,000
4	80,000
5	110,000
6	150,000
7	200,000
8	300,000
9	500,000
10	1,000,000

This data reflects a typical corporate structure, ranging from junior to executive-level roles.

🧠 Key Concepts
✅ Decision Tree Regression
A non-parametric supervised learning method that predicts values by learning simple decision rules.

Divides the data into regions using threshold splits, creating a step-wise approximation of the target variable.

No feature scaling required because it doesn't rely on distance-based calculations.

✅ Data Preprocessing Notes
No need for feature scaling

Ensure any categorical data is encoded if used in future datasets.

This project does not split the dataset into training/test sets to maximize data for learning (ideal for small datasets).

⚙️ Project Steps
Import Libraries

Load and Prepare Dataset

Build and Train Decision Tree Regressor

Predict Salary for Position Level 6.5

Visualize Results

Plot step-wise prediction curve

📈 Visualization
The model predicts constant values within intervals (as opposed to smooth curves).

You'll see a step-wise function, reflecting how Decision Trees make splits at discrete thresholds.

We also visualize predictions at higher resolution to better understand the decision boundaries.

❓ What happens if we perform feature scaling for Decision Tree Regression?
🔍 Short Answer:
It doesn't help, and it might even slightly harm the performance or interpretability of your model.

📌 Here's Why:
✅ 1. Decision Trees are not sensitive to feature scales
Decision trees split the data based on feature thresholds, not distances or magnitudes.

For example, they might ask: "Is Level < 6.5?" — they don’t care if the level is 6.5 or 0.65 (after scaling),
they just split based on relative order.

🚫 2. Feature scaling can distort the natural meaning
Scaling changes the scale of features without changing the order, so while trees still work, 
the resulting splits (like 0.65 instead of 6.5) are less interpretable.

This can make your tree’s behavior harder to explain, especially in visualizations.

⚠️ 3. Unnecessary computation
You're adding computational steps that have no benefit for performance or accuracy.

Unlike models like SVM, KNN, or Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forests don’t benefit from scaling.

🧪 Example:
Let’s say your data looks like this:

Level	Salary
1	45,000
2	50,000
...	...

If you scale Level to between 0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler:

Scaled Level	Salary
0.0	45,000
0.111	50,000

The decision tree will still split correctly, but now at values like 0.65 instead of 6.5 — and this just adds confusion with no gain.

✅ Final Recommendation:
Do NOT apply feature scaling when using Decision Tree Regression or Random Forests.

They're invariant to monotonic transformations like scaling and will perform just as well (or better) without it.
