Imagine you have a big box of crayons. Each crayon has many colors mixed in, like red, blue, green, and more.

Now, let's say you want to group crayons by who likes them:

Group 1: Kids who like red

Group 2: Kids who like green

Group 3: Kids who like blue

But all your crayons are jumbled up and mixed.

What LDA does is this:

It helps you find the best way to line up the crayons, so that it's easy to see which group each crayon belongs to.

Supervised: Unlike PCA (which is unsupervised and maximizes variance), LDA considers the class label, making it a supervised method.
