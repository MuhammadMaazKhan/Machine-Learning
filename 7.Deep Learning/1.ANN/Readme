### ✅ **Dataset Purpose**

The dataset belongs to a **bank** and is used to predict **whether a customer will leave (churn) or stay** with the bank based 
on their profile and activity.

This type of project is crucial in **Customer Retention** for businesses.

# 🔮 Bank Customer Churn Prediction using Deep Learning

This project uses a Deep Neural Network built with **TensorFlow 2.0** to predict customer churn (whether a customer leaves the bank
or not).

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains customer data from a bank, including personal details, financial behavior, and activity status.
The goal is to predict the `Exited` column which indicates churn.

**Features include:**

* Demographics: Geography, Gender, Age
* Financial: Credit Score, Balance, Salary
* Account Activity: Tenure, IsActiveMember, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard
* Target: Exited (0 = stayed, 1 = left)

## 🧠 Model

A **Fully Connected Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** using TensorFlow/Keras is used:

* 2 Hidden Layers
* ReLU Activation
* Output Layer with Sigmoid (Binary Classification)
* Optimizer: Adam
* Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy
* Metrics: Accuracy

## 🧪 Steps

1. Data Preprocessing

   * Feature selection, encoding, scaling
2. ANN Building

   * Initialization, adding layers
3. Training

   * Compile and fit on training data
4. Evaluation

   * Predicting churn on test set
   * Confusion matrix, accuracy
5. Deployment

   * Predict churn for a **single new customer**

## 🚀 Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow 2.0 / Keras
* Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
* Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 📦 Files

* `Churn_Modelling.csv`: Dataset file
* `ArtificialNeuralNetwork.ipynb`: Code implementation notebook
* `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

## 🧩 Future Improvements

* Hyperparameter tuning
* Dealing with class imbalance
* Adding dropout for regularization
* Model interpretability (e.g., SHAP)
