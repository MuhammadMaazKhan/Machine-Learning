CNN

- Convolution Operation – Learning how feature detectors (filters) work to extract patterns from images.
- ReLU Layer – Introducing non-linearity to improve image recognition.
- Pooling – Understanding max pooling and other techniques to reduce computational complexity while preserving important features.
- Flattening – Converting pooled feature maps into a single vector for further processing.
- Fully Connected Layers – Bringing everything together to classify images correctly.
- Softmax & Cross-Entropy (Optional) – Understanding key terms used in CNNs for classification tasks
