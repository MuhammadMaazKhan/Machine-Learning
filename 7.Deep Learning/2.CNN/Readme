CNN

- Convolution Operation ‚Äì Learning how feature detectors (filters) work to extract patterns from images.
- ReLU Layer ‚Äì Introducing non-linearity to improve image recognition.
- Pooling ‚Äì Understanding max pooling and other techniques to reduce computational complexity while preserving important features.
- Flattening ‚Äì Converting pooled feature maps into a single vector for further processing.
- Fully Connected Layers ‚Äì Bringing everything together to classify images correctly.
- Softmax & Cross-Entropy (Optional) ‚Äì Understanding key terms used in CNNs for classification tasks

### üõ†Ô∏è **Core CNN Operations**

1. **Convolution** ‚Äì Extracts features using filters/kernels.
2. **Max Pooling** ‚Äì Reduces image size, keeps dominant features.
3. **Flattening** ‚Äì Transforms feature maps into a 1D vector for classification.

These steps allow CNNs to go from **raw pixel data** to **meaningful labels** like "happy face," "dog," or "stop sign."
